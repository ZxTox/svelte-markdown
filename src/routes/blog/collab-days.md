# ü§î My thoughts on the sessions

I had a great time at CollabDays and I learned a lot of new things that aren't necessarily seen at school. Overall it was a great event and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about Microsoft 365 and the Power Platform. We had some time to talk to the speakers and ask them questions. We also had some time to network with other people & talk about the job market.
