# 🚀 Svelte vs React

A comparison between Svelte and React. Which one is better?
There are many frameworks out there that you can use to build your web applications. But which one is the best? In this article I will compare Svelte and React. I will compare them on the following topics:

- Performance
- Size
- Learning curve
- Community
- Ecosystem
- Tooling
- Documentation
- Testing
- State management
- Styling
- Routing
- Server-side rendering
- TypeScript support

# 🔭 Performance

Svelte is obviously faster than React. Svelte is a compiler that converts your declarative components into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM. React is a library that uses a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that is a representation of the DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details. The virtual DOM is synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. The main benefit of the virtual DOM is that it can track changes in a more granular way than the browser’s DOM. This means that the library can update only the specific parts of the DOM that actually changed. This is a lot faster than the browser’s DOM. But Svelte is still faster than React.

# 🤯 Size

Svelte is smaller than React.

# 👉 Learning curve

# 📝 Community

Svelte has a smaller community than React.

# 📚 Ecosystem

Svelte has a smaller ecosystem than React.

# 🛠 Tooling

Svelte has a smaller tooling than React.

# 📖 Documentation

Svelte has a better documentation than React.

# 🧪 Testing

Svelte has a better testing than React.

# 📦 State management

Svelte comes with stores out of the box. React has a lot of state management libraries. Redux is the most popular one. But it is not the only one. There are also MobX, Recoil, Zustand, etc.

## Example of a store in Svelte

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const count = writable(0);
```

## Example of a store in React

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

export const useCount = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	return { count, setCount };
};
```

# 🎨 Styling

Svelte has a better styling than React.

# 🚦 Routing

Svelte has a better routing than React.

# 🖥 Server-side rendering

Both Svelte and React have a good server-side rendering. While Svelte uses Sveltekit, React uses Next.js or Remix.

# 📦 TypeScript support

Both Svelte and React have a good TypeScript support.

# 📚 Conclusion

Svelte is better than React.
