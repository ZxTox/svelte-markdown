# üöÄ My day at Dell Technologies Forum 2022 Brussels

> This is a recap of my day at Dell Technologies Forum 2022 Brussels.

# üî≠ What is Dell Technologies Forum 2022 Brussels?

The Dell Technologies Forum in Brussels is an event hosted by Dell Technologies. I must say I really liked the unique venue, the Silos Brussels. Everything was so well organized, from the shuttle bus which departed from Brussels North station to the food and drinks, a big thumbs up for the organizers. The main topics of the event were the Future of Work, Cyber Security, Multi-Cloud, and the Modern Datacenter.

It was pretty funny that we were the only students at the event. We were also the only ones who had a student badge. I guess we were the only ones who were brave enough to attend the event. I'm glad we did because it was a great experience!

# ü§Ø The sponsors

I mean the sponsors speak for themselves. I was really impressed by the number of sponsors. I knew that it was going to be an insane event.

# ‚è±Ô∏è The sessions

Every session was in a different room. And to attend a session, you had to grab a pair of headphones. The headphones were connected to a receiver that was connected to the speaker. This way, you could hear the speaker without disturbing the other sessions. I thought it was pretty cool!

> Mercy Ships is an international charity that operates hospital ships in developing nations. Mercy Ships provides free lifesaving surgeries for people where medical care is nearly non-existent. It has quite the technology stack! Running on Dell Technologies HCI, VxRail, PowerScale, and Data Domain.

Overall it was a very interesting session. I learned a lot about Mercy Ships and how they use technology to help people in need. I also learned about the challenges they face when trying to provide medical care in developing nations. It was a great way to start the day! Props to Koen Segers & Cecilia Villa for the great presentation.

# ü§î Conclusion

I had a great time at the Dell Technologies Forum 2022 Brussels. I learned a lot about the latest technologies and how they can be used to improve our lives. I also met some interesting people who are working on exciting projects that will change the world for the better. If you're interested in learning more about these topics, I highly recommend attending one of these events in the future! It was probably the best event I've ever attended in terms of content, networking, sponsors, and organization. I'm looking forward to the next one!
